        He may walk alone — but he builds for everyone. <br>
        Frontend that feels alive. Backend that never breaks. <br>
        Landing pages that convert silence into sales. <br>
        Full-stack solutions forged in focus, not flash. <br>
        Bug fixes? Consider them vanished. <br>
        Responsive, fast, clean — like his footsteps through the storm. <br>
        You don’t need a team. You need the one who never stopped. <br>
        Let him turn your idea into something that lasts — even when the world feels heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
        — Alex Shivers: Solo. Steady. Successful.
